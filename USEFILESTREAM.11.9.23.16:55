How do you read that data? Well, think types. I would read it this way:

string lastname, firstname;
short ht;
in>>lastname;   // this will pick up the comma
in>>firstname;  // reads until space
in>>ht;         // reads the number and pointer goes to next last name.
Of course, if you expect any names to contain spaces (e.g. La Verne), then you had better use a getline:

getline(in,lastname,’,’);
getline(in,firstname,’\n’); // now firstname will include height and you will need
                            // to extract that information using char manip fncts*/
                            //The file stream is not connected.
